dunno what exactly what kinda of coder I want to be. orignally did c++/java in college with some c-sharp. bits of HTML as well but most of that knowledge ive lost. got sidelined due to injury and never got back to school.
haven't done much coding outside of tinkering with python and pinescript since 2010 was told to learn github so here i am :]

was in restaurants up till covid, construction last 5 years

i like graphic design, cycling, TA stock trading, gaming
also interested in AI and alternative energy
